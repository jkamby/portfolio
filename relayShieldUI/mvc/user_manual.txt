Programming notes (future User Manual):

1.	- MySQL database RelayShieldDB has 11 tables
	Entities:		RSUsers		- registered users
					RSGroups	- groups
					RSDevices	- devices
					RSFacilities- facilities
					
	Relationships:	RSGroupUserMemberships		- user-group
					RSDeviceFacilityMatches		- device-facility
					RSFacilityGroupMemberships	- group-facility
					
	Support:		RSUserTypes			- user type
					RSHouseKeepingLog	[- logs changes to the database (TODO)]
					RSActivityLog		[- logs instructions to the RelayShield (TODO)]
					RSDeletedStuff		[- keeps flat copy of all database deletions (TODO)]
					
					
					
					
2. 	- Four main enitities: Users, Groups, Devices and Facilities.

	Users:	 	- independently register at the site (anyone can register!)
				- there are 4 usertypes: 	1. regular	(1-facility operator)
											2. uber    	(multi-facility operator)
											3. admin	(user-group-device-facility assigner)
											4. super	(group-device-facility creator)
					(see table RSUserTypes in RelayShieldDB)
				- will automatically be assigned usertype regular
				[- modified by usertype admin, super (TODO)]
				- 1:1 relationship between User:UserType
				- registered in table RSUsers
				
				
	Groups:		- created/modified/deleted by usertype super
				- modified by usertype admin
				- collection of Users
				- registered in table RSGroups
				- M:N relationship between User:Group
				- table RSGroupUserMemberships captures User-Group relationships
				
				
	Devices:	- created/modified/deleted by usertype super
				- modified by usertype admin
				- registered in table RSDevices
				
				
	Facilities:	- created/modified/deleted by usertype super
				- modified by usertype admin
				- registered in table RSFacilities
				- 1:1 relationship between Device:Facility
				- table RSDeviceFacilityMatches captures Device-Facility relationships
				- M:N relationship between Group:Facility
				- table RSFacilityGroupMemberships captures Group-Facility relationships
