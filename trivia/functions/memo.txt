Project 3 CS110 solution.

This solution addresses the minimum requirements of the assignment and also the requirements for extra credit.

Essentially, the global data structure is a nested dictionary. At the first level we have the student ID's as keys with the entire record of a student stored in a dictionary as the value. So at the second level we have keys 'fname' (for first name), 'lname' (for last name), etc and these store the required data type as a value. There is data validation of the input at runtime.

As a requirement to earn extra credit, registration.py takes a comma separated value (CSV) file as a command-line argument and reads data from it. In this version this data is not validated. In the CSV file different records are stored on separate lines and data for all seven columns is put on one line separated by just commas (",") - no spaces necessary.

The code is littered with error-handling that outputs helpful messages once a user inputs an unexpected/unrecognized entry.

Of course, a lot more can be done to make it more efficient and user friendly. At least this code meets the minimum (and extra credit) requirements.

Good luck on future assignments.
