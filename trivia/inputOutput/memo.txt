Project 2 CS110 solution.

This project is a testament to how far you have come as a Python programmer.

When you can take a simple program (like banner.py) and successfully enhance it in the ways prescribed for P02 then you know you have joined the "senior league".

For those whose enhancements did not meet the requirements 100%, do not dispair. This project required all the knowledge you've acquired in class so far and then some more.

I hope you enjoyed coding it as much as I did.

Please note that you shall have to redirect input from campaign.txt when running mega_banner.py

Good luck on future assignments.
